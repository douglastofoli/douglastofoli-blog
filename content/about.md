Hello, my name is Douglas, and I am a passionate technology and programming student. Currently, I am studying Software Engineering and have professional experience in languages such as Typescript, PHP, and Elixir.

My programming journey began a few years ago when I decided to dive into the world of technology and learn how to create solutions for complex problems using code. Since then, I have dedicated myself to improving my skills and staying up to date with the latest trends and news in programming languages, tools, and technologies.

I regularly write about what I am currently learning, with a focus on sharing knowledge and helping other developers improve their skills. I hope to contribute to the technology community and learn even more from other professionals in the field.
