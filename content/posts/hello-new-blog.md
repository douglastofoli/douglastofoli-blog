### Hi, there!

Good to see you! Welcome to my new blog, 2023 version!

I have big plans for this year, one these is this new blog. A bit more simple, but with more posts (I'll try my best).

In this new website you will find below the title of this post and next to the author name a hiperlink that leave you to my repository on GitHub. Now you can suggest changes in case you find something wrong or something that can be do it better.

I think you can also sent to me a post. I review your text and if approved, your text appears here with your name. But this is only a test. I hope that I can realize all my ideias soon.

I say bye here, but not a goodbye. Soon you'll see more posts here.
