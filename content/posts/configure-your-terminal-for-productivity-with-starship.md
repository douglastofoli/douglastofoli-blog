![My terminal with ZSH and Starship](/images/my-terminal.png)

I love the terminal. It is our best frien when it comes to saving time. But the Bash vanilla is so ultrapassed. It don't complete correctly the commands. Did you create a folder with the first letter in uppercase? Well, good lucky to tell this to Bash. This is only one example that I witnessed until started use Starship with ZSH.
